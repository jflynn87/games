<h1>Game Rules and Logic</h1>



<h2>2022 Change proposals</h2>
<br>
<h3>Picks:</h3>
<p>For regular events (70 golfers and above) there will be 9 groups.  Each player will pick 2 golfers from group 1 and 1 from each of the remaining groups.
    The first 5 groups will have 10 golfers each.  Groups 6-9 will divide the remaining golfers.  Handicaps will continue to apply.  </p>
<p>For events with between 30 and 69 golfers the field will be divided into 10 groups. One pick per group</p>
<p>For events less than 30 golfers, groups will be 3 golfers per group with any remainder in the last group.  One pick per group.</p>

<h3>Cut Scores</h3>
  <p>For groups 1-3, the cut score will be calculated as: total golfers making the cut + 1 + number of golfers in the group making the cut.  
    For groups 4 and above the cut score will be: total golfers making the cut + 1  (same as current logic)</p>
  <p>WD/DQ before the cut will follow the logic above.  A post cut WD/DQ will continue to be ranked as the last place golfer making the cut with no group penalty.</p>

<h3>Pick Deadline</h3>
<p>If picks are not submitted before the tournament start, random/auto picks will be created at the start of play.
    No bonuses if using those picks (same as 2021).  But using the extended deadline, picks can be changed before a golfer tees off and then bonuses will be available.</p>
<p>Changes can be made to picks before a golfer tees off.  Once a golfer has teed off they will be locked.</p>
<p>There will be no extensions to the deadline unless there is a technical issue with the website.</p>

<h3>Trifecta</h3>
<p>50 point bonus for picking the 1, 2 and 3 place golfers (including T2/T3).
    If there is a tie for second, you need to pick the winner and 2 of the golfers T2.
    If there is a T3, you need to pick the winner, second place and one of the T3 golfers.
    Only available when the field is more than 70 golfers.  In addition to winner, playoff and best in group bonuses.</p>

<h3>Winner Bonuses</h3>
<p>Based on field quality, the weekly winner will get a bonus.  150 for a major, 100 for a strong field, 50 for a weak field</p>
<p>Field quality will be based on the % of top 100 WGR golfers in the field.  Formula is golfers in field/count of top 100.  Rounded to 2 decimals.
  Greater than .3 will be a strong field, less than a weak field.</p>
<p>The 4 majors and Fedex Playoff events will be majors, others will be classified based on the field quality above.</p>

<h3>Ryder Cup</h3>
<p>Field will be divided into 6 groups, with 4 golfers each.  Each will have 2 US and 2 Euro, sorted by OWGR</p>
<p>One pick per group</p>
<p>Score is calculated as -10 for a win, +10 for a loss.  Additional points added for winning margin, 1 * number of holes, so +/- 2 for 2&1, +/- 3 for 3&2, etc</p>
<p>Pick winning team - 25 point bonus</p>
<p>Pick winnning team and score.  Closest (under or over) 25 points.  If a tie, all picks get the bonus.</p>
<p>Field is considered a strong field, winning score -100 points</p>
<br>

<h3>FedEx</h3>
<p>At the start of the season pick 30 golfers who you think will make it to the Tour Championship.</p>
<p>30 points for any correct pick</p>
<p>+50 for any pick that was outside the top 30 OWGR as of the start of the season</p>
<p>-20 for any pick that was in the top 30 but doesn't make it</p>

<h3>Ozaki-san rules</h3>
<p>Pays full $300 entry fee</p>
<p>He will get the average score per event for the first 11 events, placing him in 6th place (excluding FedEx impact)</p>
<p>For FedEx picks, he is prohibited from picking anyone outside the top 50 who is currently inside the top 30.  All other players are available</p>
<p>The payout for majors (the actual 4 majors only) will be increased to $100 for the winner.  The reaminaing money from Ozaki-san's entry will be part of the year end payout.</p>


<h2>2021 Rules</h2>

<h3>Groups:</h3>
<p>For fields with 65 golfers or more, 6 groups.  One pick for groups 1-5, 5 picks in group 6</p>
<p>For fields between 30 - 64, the field will be divided into 10 groups with remainder in the last group and 1 pick per group. </p>
<p>For fields of less thatn 30, the field will be divided into groups of 3 per group (reminder in the last group) and 1 pick per group </p>

<h3>Handicap</h3>
<p>Each pick will receive a handicap equal to 1% of his OWGR.  That handicap will be deducted from the golfers position on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The handicap will be a whole number, and rounded.  So the top 49 OWGR get 0 handicap, rank 2043 will get 20</p>
<p>The max handicap will be set to 13% of the field size.</p>
<p>Handicap will apply to any score, a cut or qualifying will benefit from the handicap</p>

<H3>Bonuses</H3>
<p>If you miss the pick deadline, no bonuses will be applied.  </p>
<p>Winner Bonus - same as today, 50 + (group# *2)</p>
<p>Playoff Bonus - losers in a playoff get a 25 point bonus</p>
<p>No cut bonus - total golfers in field - total making the cut.  For example, in a regular event 154 golfers - 65 mkaing the cut = bonus of 89</p>
<p>Major/WGC/Players/Memorial Bonus - 100 points for winning picks (split in the case of a tie)</p>
<p>Low Score in group bonus - 10 points for any pick that is best in the group.  Does not apply to the tournament winner or playoff participant.  Only available when there are 5 or more golfers per group.</p>

<h3>Additional Prizes</h3>
<p>The FedEx playoff events will be treated as majors.  </p>

<h3>Match Play</h3>
<p>Golfers put into groups per the tournament field.  There are 16 groups of 4, make 1 pick per group.</p>
<p>If a pick fails to make a round, the score will be number of golfers in the round +1.  So 17 if failing to make the final 16, 9 if losing in the round of 16, 5 if losing in final 8.</p>
<p>Winner through 4th place get the points for their finish (1-4)</p>
<p>As a WGC event, major bonus (-100) and $50 prize apply.</p>
<p>Winner bonus for winning pick of -50, no group multiplier.  -25 point bonus for loser in the final.</p>
<p>No best in group, no cut or playoff bonuses.</p>
<p>No handicaps</p>
 

<h2>2020 Rules:</h2>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>$300 per player.  There are 9 of us, so $2700 total pot.</p> 
<p>Normal event weekly prize is $30.  For majors, WGC and The Players the prize is $50.</p> 
<p>The remaining money will be split with 70% going to the winner and 30% for second place.  That should be $915 for winner and $405 for second, assuming there are 39 tournaments.</p>
<p>Note - there is a $30 web hosting fee deducted from the winners prize (John's crappy programming is free) </p>
<h3>Weekly Field:</h3>
<p>Thru the year there are different field sizes, with most tournaments have 156 player.  Groups are created by OWGR for the player.  The group logic works like this</p>
<ul>
  <li>For 120 golfers or more – groups 1-5 have 10 golfers, group 6+ have 15.  When there are less than 15 golfers remaining, they are added to the final group (so in a 156 tournament the last group has 16 gofers.  If there are 154 (I don’t think this actually happens) the last group will be 29 golfers).</li>
  <li>Tournaments with less than 120 players there will be 10 groups, again any odd numbers in the last group.  There are some tournaments with 100 golfers, so they will be 10 x 10.  There are some with 30, they are 10 groups with 3 golfers in each.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pick Deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline is 23:59 the day prior to the tournament start date in Pacific Time.  This works for all US tournament,  for others let’s make sure we get picks in early and I will manually open it up the scoring page once they are all in (this is an issue the next few weeks when tournaments are in Asia as well as for the Open Championship).</p>
<p>If you miss the pick deadline, you will get random picks and not be eligible for bonus points for winner or cut.</p>


<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add up the ranks of each selected golfer</li>
  <li>Any cut golfer gets a rank of the number of players making the cut +1 (in round 1 this is hard coded to 66, in round 2 it is based on the projected cut line so will change as that changes).</li>
  <li>Note - If a tournament has an mdf, there is a second cut on Sat that resets the field to top 70 and ties.  Friday cuts will get a score of the Friday cut number +1.  Sat cuts will get the actual rank in the tournament.  For example, if 80 golfers make the cut on Friday all cut golfers get 81.  If 70 make it after Sat, the 10 golfers who are cut get their actual rank.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bonus Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If none of your picks are cut you will a bonus of the number of golfers in the original field - the golfers making the cut.  In s regular event that is 156 - 65 = 91</li>
  <li>If you pick the tournament winner you will get a bonus of –(50 + (group x2)).  So if somehow your group 15 pick wins the tournament you will get -80.</li>
  <p>If you win a major, WGC, or The Players you will get a -100 bonus for that tounament.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Withdrawals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If a pick withdraws after the start of play, that counts as a cut.</li>
  <li>WD’s before a tournament starts wil be emailed at 12:00est on Wed before the tournament, please change any of those picks.  Also, if you notice any WD picks please line the group.  </li>
  <li>If a pick withdraws before the start, you have until 3 hours after the start to nominate a new pick.  If you don't make a new pick by the deadline, you get the golfer at the mid point of the remaining group</li>
</ul>
