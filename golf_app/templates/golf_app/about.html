<h1>Game Rules and Logic</h1>



<h2>2021 Rules</h2>

<h3>Groups:</h3>
<p>For fields with 65 golfers or more, 6 groups.  One pick for groups 1-5, 5 picks in group 6</p>
<p>For fields less than 31, 3 groups (e.g. Hero Challengs, Kapalua), 1 pick per group </p>
<p>For fields between 31 - 66, the field will be divided byinto groups of 10 per group (reminder in the last group) and 1 pick per group </p>

<h3>Handicap</h3>
<p>Each pick will receive a handicap equal to 10% of his OWGR.  That handicap will be dedcuted from the golfers position on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The handicap will be a whole number, and rounded.  So the top 50 OWGR get 0 handicap, rank 2043 will get 20</p>
<p>Handicap will apply to any score, a cut or qulifying will benefit from the handicap</p>

<H3>Bonuses</H3>
<p>Winner Bonus - samea as today, 50 + (group# *2)</p>
<p>Playoff Bonus - losers in a playoff, 25 + (group# * 2)</p>
<p>No cut bonus - total golfers in field - total making the cut.  For example, in a regular event 154 golfers - 65 mkaing the cut = bonus of 89</p>
<p>Major/WGC/Players/Memorial Bonus - 100 points for winning picks (split in the case of a tie)</p>
<p>Low Score in grtoup bonus - 10 points for any pick that is best in the group.  Does not apply to the tournament winner or playoff particpant</p>





<h2>2020 Rules:</h2>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>$300 per player.  There are 9 of us, so $2700 total pot.</p> 
<p>Normal event weekly prize is $30.  For majors, WGC and The Players the prize is $50.</p> 
<p>The remaining money will be split with 70% going to the winner and 30% for second place.  That should be $915 for winner and $405 for second, assuming there are 39 tournaments.</p>
<p>Note - there is a $30 web hosting fee deducted from the winners prize (John's crappy programming is free) </p>
<h3>Weekly Field:</h3>
<p>Thru the year there are different field sizes, with most tournaments have 156 player.  Groups are created by OWGR for the player.  The group logic works like this</p>
<ul>
  <li>For 120 golfers or more – groups 1-5 have 10 golfers, group 6+ have 15.  When there are less than 15 golfers remaining, they are added to the final group (so in a 156 tournament the last group has 16 gofers.  If there are 154 (I don’t think this actually happens) the last group will be 29 golfers).</li>
  <li>Tournaments with less than 120 players there will be 10 groups, again any odd numbers in the last group.  There are some tournaments with 100 golfers, so they will be 10 x 10.  There are some with 30, they are 10 groups with 3 golfers in each.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pick Deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline is 23:59 the day prior to the tournament start date in Pacific Time.  This works for all US tournament,  for others let’s make sure we get picks in early and I will manually open it up the scoring page once they are all in (this is an issue the next few weeks when tournaments are in Asia as well as for the Open Championship).</p>
<p>If you miss the pick deadline, you will get random picks and not be eligible for bonus points for winner or cut.</p>
<p>If you win a major, WGC, or The Players you will get a -100 bonus for that tounament.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add up the ranks of each selected golfer</li>
  <li>Any cut golfer gets a rank of the number of players making the cut +1 (in round 1 this is hard coded to 66, in round 2 it is based on the projected cut line so will change as that changes).</li>
  <li>Note - If a tournament has an mdf, there is a second cut on Sat that resets the field to top 70 and ties.  Friday cuts will get a score of the Friday cut number +1.  Sat cuts will get the actual rank in the tournament.  For example, if 80 golfers make the cut on Friday all cut golfers get 81.  If 70 make it after Sat, the 10 golfers who are cut get their actual rank.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bonus Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If none of your picks are cut you will a bonus of the number of golfers in the original field - the golfers making the cut.  In s regular event that is 156 - 65 = 91</li>
  <li>If you pick the tournament winner you will get a bonus of –(50 + (group x2)).  So if somehow your group 15 pick wins the tournament you will get -80.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Withdrawals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If a pick withdraws after the start of play, that counts as a cut.</li>
  <li>WD’s before a tournament starts wil be emailed at 12:00est on Wed before the tournament, please change any of those picks.  Also, if you notice any WD picks please line the group.  </li>
</ul>
