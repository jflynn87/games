<h1>Game Rules and Logic</h1>

<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>$200 per player.  There are 6 of us, so $1200 total pot.  Weekly winner will get $25 (18 weeks) and the app will keep a running point total for the season.  Low score for the full season wins $600, seond place wins $150 (80% and 20% of the remaining).  Any ties result in a split of the pot for the week/year.</p>
<p>Note - there is a $30 web hosting fee deducted from the winners prize (John's crappy programming is free) </p>

<h3>Logic:</h3>
<p>The goal is to have the lowest point total.  Pick the winner for each game (straight up, no spread).  If your pick does not win, you get that many points added to your score.  Ties are a loss.</p>
<p>The pick you are most confident in should be #16.  Least confident, the lowest number pick.  In bye weeks the low numbers are cut, so each week has a 16 pick and the low number will change from 1-3 depending on the number of byes.  </p>

<h3>Pick Deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline is the start of the first game of the week.</p> 
<p>The following logic will apply to missing the pick deadline:</p>
<ul>
    
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Normal Week - defined as a week with 1 game on Thurs night, the remaining games on the weekend</li>
    <ul>
    <li>You will get the loser of the Thurs night game as your #16 pick</li>
    <li>The system will automatically pick the underdogs for remaining picks.  The sorting will be the biggest dog as #15 thru the smallest dog at the low pick (e.g. pick #1 if a full week)</li>
    <li>You will be able to change the auto picks (other than #16) until a games starts.  Once a game starts, the pick is locked</li>
    <li>You will not be able to see other picks or the scores until you submit your picks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Special Week - defined as a week that doesn't have just 1 game on Thurs night.  For example, Thanksgiving week, last week of season. etc.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The pick deadline is the start of the first game</li>
    <li>The system will automatically pick the underdogs, the sorting will be the biggest dog as #16 thru the smallest dog at the low pick (e.g. pick #1 if a full week)</li>
    <li>No changes to the auto picks on special weeks</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note - For picks made by the deadline, no changes allowed once the week begins. This is to avoid picking against other players after seeing their picks.</p>


<h3>Cancelled Games</h3>
<p>Any game that is cancelled after picks are made will be deleted and all picks below that pick number will have 1 added to them.  For example if your number 3 pick is for a cancelled game, pick pick 2 becomes pick 3, pick 1 becomes pick 2 and there is no pick 1 for that week. </p>

<h3>Full Season Side Pool</h3>
<p>$10 buy in.  Participation optional, but highly encouraged</p>
<p>Before the start of the season, pick the winner of every game</p>
<p>Sum of correct picks for sesason wins</p>
<p>Ties lose</p>
<p>Winner take all, pot split in case of tie</p>
