<h1>Game Rules and Logic</h1>

<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>$200 per player.  There are 10 of us, so $1800 total pot.  Weekly winner will get $25 and the app will keep a running point total for the season.  Low score for the full season wins $xxx, seond place wins $$$.  Any ties result in a split of the pot for the week/year.</p>

<h3>Logic:</h3>
<p>The goal is to have the lowest point total.  Pick the winner for each game (straight up, no spread).  If your pick does not win, you get that many points added to your score.  Ties are a loss.</p>
<p>The pick you are most confident in should be #16.  Least confidence, the lowest number pick.  In bye weeks the low numbers are cut, so each week has a 16 pick and the low number will change from 1-3 depending on the number of byes.  </p>

<h3>Pick Deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline is the start of the first game of the week.  If you fail to make picks the default is the underdogs in reverse order based on the spread.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add up the ranks of each selected golfer</li>
  <li>Any cut golfer gets a rank of the number of players making the cut +1 (in round 1 this is hard coded to 71, in round 2 it is based on the projected cut line so will change as that changes).</li>
  <li>Note - If more than 78 players make the cut in a standard tournament, there is a second cut on Sat that resets the field to top 70 and ties.  Friday cuts will get a score of the Friday cut number +1.  Sat cuts will get the actual rank in the tournament.  For example, if 80 golfers make the cut on Friday all cut golfers get 81.  If 70 make it after Sat, the 10 golfers who are cut get their actual rank.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bonus Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If none of your picks are cut you will get -50 from your score  (this is updated, it was 10 in the majors but since we never had it a bigger bonus seems justified).</li>
  <li>If you pick the tournament winner you will get a bonus of –(50 + (group x2).  So if somehow your group 15 pick wins the tournament you will get -80.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Withdrawals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If a pick withdraws after the start of play, that counts as a cut.</li>
  <li>WD’s before a tournament starts are hard to find.  The app shows it, but not until after all picks are all made and the PGA starts making their score file available (which is close to the tournament start).  My proposal is that we try first to look out for each other when we check the picks each week and let each other know if we see a WD on the score page.  If a replacement is nominated before 10am local time of the tournament we take that pick.  If it is after, the pick will be the golfer ranked at the middle of the group (and if there are multiple golfers, you can pick from them).</li>
</ul>
